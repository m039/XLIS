# Cross-Language Interaction Sandbox

Various experiments with programming languages and platforms. 

## Examples of cross-language polymorphism

First language in the name of a folder is a host language. For example, `CSharp-Cpp-Interop` means: "I want to use C++ in a C# enviroment".

### C# and C++
* `CSharp-Cpp-CppSharp`
* `CSharp-Cpp-Interop`
* `CSharp-Cpp-SWIG`
* `Cpp-CSharp-Blackmire`

### Swift and C++ 
* `ObjC-Swift-Interop`

## Example in multiplatform environment
* `Cpp-Cross-Platform` - example of using C++ on iOS, Android, Windows and Mac with Xamarin.

## Notes
- `CppLibraryProject` is copy-pasted and slightly modified across the projects, to make it obvious which differences each approach has.
- All projects were tested on mac.
