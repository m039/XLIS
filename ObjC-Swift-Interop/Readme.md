# ObjC & Swift Interop Example

Example how one may implement Swift interface in ObjC and pass it back to Swift.

* `SwiftLibrary` - a core library.
* `SwiftConsoleProject` and `ObjCConsoleProject` are examples how to use the core library.
* `Precompiled` is a folder which contains a static library.

## Notes

- I would like to bypass ObjC/C++ and use SwiftLibrary directly in a C++ project, but I don't know how to do it without ObjC++.
- Possibility to use Swift from ObjC/C++ (and vise-versa) is out of the box.
